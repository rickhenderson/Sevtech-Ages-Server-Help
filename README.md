# Installation Requirements
The SevTech client itself requires at least 3GB of RAM, even though the Twitch installation page says it will run with 1GB. It won't.

## Server Installation
The SevTech Ages server requires Java version 8 in order to run correctly.When visiting the Oracle site to download the package, you may need to create an account. If you prefer, create a burner email account in order to download the packge using a site such as <a href="https://10minutemail.com/">10-Minute Mail</a> or <a href="https://maildrop.cc/">Maildrop</a> (not secure).

The server will require the Java Development Kit (JDK) so make sure you install it. It does not have to be installed first.
